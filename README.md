# GH-Actions_INFA_basic_pipeline

[Instructions](https://knowledge.informatica.com/s/article/Automated-Deployment-of-IICS-Assets-CI-CD-using-Informatica-API-s?language=en_US) I'm trying to repeat

How it functions as of 05/09/2022: 

1. User makes changes in INFA UI DEV

2. User commits changes to GitHub

3. Even without workflow, from GitHub we can merge from DEV to UAT

4. From INFA UI UAT user makes Pull, and confirms connections
